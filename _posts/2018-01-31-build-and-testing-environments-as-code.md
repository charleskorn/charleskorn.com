Last night I spoke at the [DevOps Melbourne meetup](https://www.meetup.com/devops-melbourne/events/246634083/),
presenting on _Build and testing environments as code: because life's too short not too_.

The slides are available to [download as a PDF](/files/2018/Build and testing environments as code.pdf),
the sample environment I used during the presentation is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect-sample-java),
and you can find more information about batect on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect).
