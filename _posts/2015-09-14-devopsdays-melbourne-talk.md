_I've been holding off posting about this because I was hoping the video would be posted, but it doesn't seem to be coming...
I'll update this post if it does come out._

I gave a lightning / Pecha Kucha-style talk at [DevOpsDays Melbourne](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-melbourne/)
on July 16 about our how we were able to deliver multiple production deployments a week at Trim for Life.
This involved the use of (amongst other things) a microservices architecture, a backwards- and
forwards-compatible data storage mechanism, fully automated deployment pipelines and automated monitoring.
