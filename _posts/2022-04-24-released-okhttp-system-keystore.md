I've just published [`okhttp-system-keystore`](https://github.com/charleskorn/okhttp-system-keystore/), a small library that makes it easy
to use trusted certificates from the operating system keystore (Keychain on macOS, Certificate Store on Windows) with [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/).

Feedback, suggestions and ideas are welcome!
