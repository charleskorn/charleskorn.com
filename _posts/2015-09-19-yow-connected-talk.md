[Greg Skinner](http://gregskinner.wordpress.com) and I gave a presentation at [Yow Connected](http://connected.yowconference.com.au)
in Melbourne on September 17, where we discussed how pairing can be a very effective form of collaboration for developers and designers.

The talk was recorded, so I hope there will be a video of it available soon. In the meantime, you can download a PDF version of the slides
[here](/files/2015/Yow Connected Presentation.pdf).

The final version of the app we developed during the presentation is still live at
[http://yc.charleskorn.com](http://yc.charleskorn.com), and
[the source code is also on GitHub](https://github.com/charleskorn/yow-connected-2015).
