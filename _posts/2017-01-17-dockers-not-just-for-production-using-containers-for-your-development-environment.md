Tonight I spoke at the [ThoughtWorks Hamburg meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Hamburg/events/235900641/),
presenting _Docker's not just for production: using containers for your development environment_.

The slides are available to [download as a PDF](/files/2017/Docker for development environments.pdf), 
and the sample Docker-based development environment I used during the presentation is 
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/charleskorn/docker-dev-env-sample-app).
