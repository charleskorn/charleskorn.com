Tonight I spoke at the [ThoughtWorks Munich meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Munich/events/238297588/),
presenting an updated version of my presentation _Docker's not just for production: using containers for your development environment_.
There are two major changes over the [previous version](/2017/01/18/dockers-not-just-for-production-using-containers-for-your-development-environment/):

* I've added a section about using containers to manage test environments, in addition to the existing content about build environments
* I've reworked the structure of the presentation based on feedback to focus more on the technique itself rather than a discussion of existing alternatives

The slides are available to [download as a PDF](/files/2017/Docker for development environments v2.pdf), 
and the sample environment I used during the presentation is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/charleskorn/docker-dev-env).
