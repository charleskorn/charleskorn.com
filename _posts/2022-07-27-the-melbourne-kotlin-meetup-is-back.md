I'm super excited that [the Melbourne Kotlin meetup](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-kotlin-meetup) is back after a 
COVID-induced hiatus, and I'm just as excited to be presenting!

Come down to the Block-AfterPay offices at 6pm on August 11 to hear Zenab Bohra present "Introduction to FP in Kotlin", 
and I'll be talking about "Embedding Golang in a Kotlin app: how to do it and why you shouldn't".

For more details, and to RSVP, check out [the August meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-kotlin-meetup/events/287443299/).

**Update**: the recording of both talks are now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFX43T1t6l8). 
Zenab's talk begins at [3:34](https://youtu.be/lFX43T1t6l8?t=214), and my talk starts at [45:00](https://youtu.be/lFX43T1t6l8?t=2700).
