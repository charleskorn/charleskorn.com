[Greg Skinner](http://gregskinner.wordpress.com) and I gave a presentation at [Yow Connected](http://connected.yowconference.com.au) last year on [developers and designers pairing](/2015/09/19/yow-connected-talk), and we've written a follow-up article for the ThoughtWorks Insights blog: ['Developers and Designers Can Pair Too'](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/developers-and-designers-can-pair-too).
