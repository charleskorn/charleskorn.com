Last month I spoke at ThoughtWorks Australia's inaugural 'Evolution by ThoughtWorks' conference in Melbourne and Sydney,
presenting on _Build and testing environments as code: because life's too short not too_.

The slides and video from the talk are now available 
[on the ThoughtWorks website](https://www.thoughtworks.com/evolution-by-thoughtworks/content#Presentations).

The sample environment I used during the presentation is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect-sample-java),
and you can find more information about batect on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect).
